# MobasyBuildingData

### MOBASY Building Data 

The package consists of data tables / data frames with a specific structure used for monitoring and energy performance calculation. Datasets of a building stock sample are included. The following data frames are available:

- **"Data_Input":**
    Input data structure (energy profile monitoring indicators and measured consumption) with exemplary datasets 

- **"Data_Output":** 
    Output data structure (calculated energy performance) without values, used as template for the MOBASY Model output

- **"Data_Output_PreCalculated":** 
    Output data table containing the energy performance values already calculated by the MOBASY Model (by use of the workbook "EnergyProfile.xlsm")

- **"Info_Variables":** 
    A table including descriptions and units of the variables (in English and German)

### Method

The building data tables were developed and used in the MOBASY research project (https://www.iwu.de/forschung/energie/mobasy/). The datasets from the building stock sample compiled and evaluated during the project are also included as examples. The input values can be used by the MOBASY model for realistic energy performance calculation and target/actual comparison, the input and output values can be statistically evaluated.
 
An introduction to the energy profile indidators used to monitor housing stocks and the MOBASY model including uncertainty assessment used for realistic energy performance calculation and target/actual comparison can be found in this article:
